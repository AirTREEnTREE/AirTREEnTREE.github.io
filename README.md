### Ideas

#### Tree Finder App 

- easy to use phone application to find trees and plants
- think geocaching but with natural bounty
- calendar of when trees and plants are fruiting
- use gov datasets to id public trees
- users can submit extra data

Graphql backend. Frontend/Phone app devs required!

#### Marketplace

- wanted and for sale ads
- links to a saplings parent (from Tree Finder App)

#### Forum
